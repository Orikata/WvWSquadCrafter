- **Left click once** to copy.
- **Left click on a party slot** to add a class.
- **Left click on the Sync button** to copy the class onto that entire row.
- **Right click while holding a class** to clear it or replace with the empty squares in the palette.
- You can re-write the headers of the columns too for your own use.

I might add color for DPS/Healer/Cele roles in the future, and maybe a hotkey for taking a picture. If you want to share pictures, you can use WindowsKey+Alt+S to snip the screen. If you have suggestions I'd love to hear about them.
